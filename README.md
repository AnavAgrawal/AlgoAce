<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Installation

### A. Run with Docker

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Docker and docker compose both latest version installed on your system before proceeding. Docker compose  will be used to build and run the application in a containerized environment. For installation please refer the offcial documneation of docker [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/)

- **OpenAI API Key**:
    - To access the OpenAI API, you will need to create an API Key. You can do this by logging into the [OpenAI] (https://openai.com/product) website and navigating to the API Key management page.


### 1. Environment Setup

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project.
2. Add the following lines to the `.env` file, replacing `{YOUR_OPENAI_KEY}` with your actual OpenAI API key:

   ```env
    OPENAI_API_TOKEN={YOUR_OPENAI_KEY}
    HOST=0.0.0.0
    PORT=8080
    EMBEDDER_LOCATOR=text-embedding-ada-002
    EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=1536
    MODEL_LOCATOR=gpt-3.5-turbo
    MAX_TOKENS=400
    TEMPERATURE=0.2
   ```

This file will be used by Docker to set the environment variables inside the container.

### 2. Build and Run the Docker Image

With the environment variables set up, you can now build the Docker and run the image for the project.

- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the root directory of your project.
- Execute the following command to build and run the docker:

  ```sh
  docker compose up
  ```

This step compiles your application and its dependencies into a Docker image.


### 3. Access the Application

- Open your web browser.
- Navigate to `localhost:8501` to access the application.

You should see the application's interface if the setup was successful. This confirms that your Docker container is running and the application is accessible.

### 4. Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the setup or execution process, please check the following:

- Ensure Docker is running on your system.
- Verify that the `.env` file contains the correct API key and settings.
- Make sure the Docker image was built successfully without errors.
- Check if the Docker container is running and the ports are correctly mapped.

For further assistance, consult the Docker documentation or seek help from Docker community forums.

### B. Run with Conda

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Conda installed on your system before proceeding. Conda will be used to create an environment and run the application with all the required dependencies. If you don't have Conda installed, please follow the official [Conda Installation Guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/AnavAgrawal/AlgoAce
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
    ```
    cd AlgoAce
    ```

3. Set environment variables

    Create .env file in the root directory of the project, copy and paste the below config, and replace the {YOUR_OPENAI_KEY} configuration value with your key.

    ```env
    OPENAI_API_TOKEN={YOUR_OPENAI_KEY}
    HOST=0.0.0.0
    PORT=8080
    EMBEDDER_LOCATOR=text-embedding-ada-002
    EMBEDDING_DIMENSION=1536
    MODEL_LOCATOR=gpt-3.5-turbo
    MAX_TOKENS=400
    TEMPERATURE=0.2
   ```

4. Create a new Conda environment with the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    conda create --name myenv
    ```


5. Install dependencies
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Activate the newly created Conda environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    ```
7. Run the supervisord command to start all the processes:

    ```bash
    supervisord
    ```
    - This starts the Pathway Restful API, the Cronjob and the Streamlit UI Interface. 

8. Navigate to `localhost:8501` to access the Streamlit UI Inteface and use the application.
